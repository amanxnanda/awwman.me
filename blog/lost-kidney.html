            <p class="heading-1">The day I lost my kidney</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> The 17th of August, 2023, had started like any dull, mundane day. I went to the gym, cooked and ate
                breakfast and then went to the office. But I had a little extra bounce to my steps because I was
                supposed to go to Delhi back home in the second half of the day. This was an impromptu trip back home;
                the tickets were booked just 40 hours before the flight. So, I worked until lunchtime and ate my last
                meal in Bangalore with other team members. I made fake promises to return early, bid my goodbyes, and
                left. <br>
                <br> I hadn’t finished the packing, so I plucked some clothes from my closet, rolled them up and stuffed
                them into a bag. By this time, I was too late to go by bus, so Bangalore’s infamous cab ride to the
                Airport was the only option left, which can burn a hole in your pocket so deep that even Bruce Wayne
                from the Dark Knight trilogy without ropes can’t climb. I reached the airport on time, but time wasn’t
                the only thing I wanted to save. An hour later, I found myself in the middle seat of Vistara, where on
                the right, a cute little baby girl was not letting go of my shiny kadda (bracelet) while mumbling
                something to her grandfather and on the right was your typical boss-lady. This lady tried to squeeze in
                one last call to her subordinate to inform “how not to fuck this client up”. After a while, I started
                watching “Before Sunset,” but ironically, I couldn’t finish it before sunset. The movie and sunset
                setting on the west were both beautiful. By the time the sun was nowhere to be found, I had landed in
                Delhi. <br>
                <br> To protest against Bangalore’s last-mile infrastructure, I decided to go by Delhi metro so later I
                could rub it to Bangalore (which is impossible because it won't understand unless I speak in
                <i>Kannada</i>) to see how great Delhi is. I had been travelling in the Delhi metro before I knew the
                meaning of my name, which was eventually told by an elderly person when I was 6 or 7 in the metro. But
                my stupid ass still gets nervous, and why would it not be? There are many lines of different colours:
                red, blue, green, pink, purple, magenta and whatnot; I bet even the LGBTQIA+ flag doesn’t have that many
                colours. While leaving the airport, I said, “It’s easy; just go to the orange line, then yellow, and
                finally blue, and you’ll be home before dinner”. Orange, yellow and blue; only if it was that
                simple.<br>
                <br> I reached the orange line before I could finish the few top singles by <i>seedhe maut</i>, and
                after a while, I felt more of a <i>Punjabi</i> vibe. At 9:55 pm, I’m at the New Delhi metro station
                (orange line) waiting for the metro, which will take me to Rajiv Chowk (Yellow line), just one station
                away. I see the train coming. I grab my suitcase with my left hand, change the current track to
                <i>Rubicon Drill</i>, put my phone in my right pocket, and then prepare myself to wrestle to get onto
                the metro. The gate opens, I shove myself in, and I feel something on my right, which I knew right away
                what it was but refused to believe for a second. I did my usual pat, and it was clear as day what had
                happened. I was robbed of my most-priced possession, my constant in the sine graph of life; the only
                things closer to me were probably my intrusive thoughts. My beautiful purple iPhone 14. It was covered
                with a black matt cover, and a skin with a colourful geometric design was peeping through everywhere. It
                embodied me, and there couldn’t be a better representation of myself. People who know me know what I’m
                talking about. I had especially bought iPhone 14 so it's easier for people to call me <i>“iPhone ka
                    Chuddah (14)”</i>, which translates to “iPhone’s fuck”. All of it was long gone now.<br>
                <br> What happened right after the incident is just sad, which involved people without spine or humility
                and screwed up the state of our system. <i>Jo ho gaya so ho gaya</i> (Whatever has happened, has
                happened), and nothing can be done about it now. I pulled myself together and took the saddest
                auto-rickshaw ride of my life to home. With a heavy heart and lighter pockets, I entered the house with
                a long day gone past me but a longer face with me. <br>
                <br>End. <br>
                <br>P.S. I’m not sorry for the misleading title. <br>
