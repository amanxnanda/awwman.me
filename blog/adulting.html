            <br>
            <br>
            <p> It’s Adulting, not to be confused with Adultery, where one gets screwed for fun, and the other gets it
                because the rent is freaking expensive. <br>
                <br> For those of you who don’t know, I am 22, which barely counts as an adult, and most times, I don’t
                feel like one either. The other day I learned the better way of tying shoe laces. I have been doing it
                wrong my whole life, but now I am too lazy to adopt anything unless it’s a cat. <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Here's a list of essential adulting steps in no specific order:
                <br>
                <br>
                 1. <strong>Learn to Cook:</strong> However much we
                romanticised Maggie, that’s not what we should eat if we want to witness the Flying Cars, AI takeover,
                and RCB IPL victory.
                <br> 
                <br> 
                2. <strong>Find Your Interest:</strong> If you are like me, who has failed to
                attend the secret meeting held for the Gen-Z where they put a sorting hat on your head and choose what
                you will base your personality on: F1, anime, football or loser. Then you better choose yourself or wait
                until any of the missionaries of the above religion seduces you into joining their cult.
                <br>
                <br>
                 3. <strong>Give into FOMO:</strong> Watch the latest series/movie that your friends or colleagues are
                buzzing about. Or listen to Travis Scott’s latest album and wonder How an ultra-rich black dude brought
                up in a different social construct has any relevance to you and your life. But hey, if you don’t do any
                of that, how will you convince everyone that you are not boring and have more than two friends? 
                <br>
                <br>
                4. <strong>Make and Lose Friends:</strong> Not everyone you meet, spend time, and share laughs is your
                friend. More often than not, they are just co-passengers on life’s journey. Learn to embrace the moments
                and free the person out of them. People will come and go (Doors will open on the left. Please mind the
                gap), if they are gone from your life, that doesn’t mean they didn’t enjoy the time. Life gets the best
                out of us: “No reason to stay is always a good reason to go” (Thanks, Camila). This should not stop
                you from making even more friends; the more, the merrier.
                <br>
                <br>
                5. <strong>Prioritise Health:</strong>
                Backache and heartache are as familiar as grey hairs in all your heads. Eating and running like a rabbit
                can keep your body in check. The heart is a slippery slope; it’s the stupidest organ. Don’t worry,
                Pancreas, you are still cute; keep giving those insulin kisses. The heart’s damn job is to pump blood, but
                instead, it catches feelings, gets attached and makes you spend the whole weekend on your bed sleeping,
                eating and wondering like a sloth. <br> As soon as you start to understand the lyrics of songs, it’s
                time for you to touch grass, read books and do laundry.
                <br>
                <br>
                6. <strong>Use Fabric Conditioner:</strong> Your clothes will look and smell better; trust me on this one.
                <br>
                <br>
                7. <strong>Help:</strong> Be there for people whenever, wherever, and however you can. They may forget and not value you and/or your
                help, but that’s all right. Remember the time when somebody helped you. Never expect anything back; otherwise, you will
                set yourself up for disappointment and a few more grey hairs.
                <br>Be there for your friends when they are going through
                heartbreak, and if you are not playing <i>Bewafa</i>, are you guys even friends?
                <br>
                <br>
                8. <strong>Steer Clear of Sensitive Topics:</strong> Politics, Feminism and what goes first, masala or Maggie, should only be discussed
                with limited people unless you are a member of Fight Club. If you find yourself in this situation, keep sipping on your
                drink and finish all the <i>Chakhna</i> :) Soon, everybody will be drunk dancing on <i>Munni Badnaam Hui</i>.
                <br>
                <br>
                9. <strong>Old/Older:</strong> I have seen my parents four times in the last two years, and I might have to spend this year’s <i>Diwali</i> away
                just like <i>Holi</i>. The reason to call shouldn’t only be to get home remedies. There shouldn’t be any reasons; talk to them.
                We are getting older and want to enjoy this youth like there is no tomorrow, but our parents are getting old.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Adulting is simple: work, get paid and have fun, but not easy. Ultimately, it’s just you and your breaths filling up the
                silence at 3 a.m.
                <br>
