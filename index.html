        <p class="heading-1">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of 2022</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>

            Contrary to the title, the year started ugly. This year started with me lying on the hospital bed with two
            fractured backbones, two broken teeth, a
            severed tongue, a
            few internal injuries and no will to ride a two-wheeler, especially the Royal Enfield, ever again. It took
            some time and
            a lot of <i>maa ki dua</i> to get back on my feet.
            <br><br>
            I turned 21 this year, and the bad started. Things were looking grim. I couldn’t enjoy what I used to, and
            each passing
            day felt the same. And I couldn’t figure out what was going on. It was the lowest point in my life despite
            having all
            the nice things around me. It took some time and courage, and I decided to go to therapy. It was no magic
            pill, but I
            did work in its sweet, sweet time. Therapy mostly made me more aware of myself and my thoughts. It gave me
            ways to deal
            with feelings, or rather lack of it, but the conflicts were still there. But I did feel ok after a few
            sessions. While
            all this was happening in my personal life, my profession wanted me to be in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. I was
            aware I would
            have to go there at some point in the future but didn’t realise till very late. I did everything in 1 week
            and hopped on
            the first-ever flight; DEL -> CJB.
            <br>
            It was a refreshing change at the start, after a week of travelling and exploring all the restaurants
            possible. I had to
            accept that now I have to live by myself, 2500 KMs away from my family, in a city whose language I don’t
            know and whose
            culture I don’t understand. A nasty incident happened in the first few days, and I was ready to go back and
            leave
            everything behind. I am so glad I didn’t do that. So, things progressed a little, but I was still fighting
            this city;
            simple things like ordering food in a mess felt like a task. The only thing that was not the problem was the
            food. I am
            a little picky eater, but I came to Coimbatore with the mindset of exploring the culture as a whole, and
            food is the
            most significant part of it. You name it, and I must have tried it;<i> Kalan, idiyappam, apam, sapad,
                pongal</i>
            and things I
            don’t remember the name of. My favourite was <i>Madala Vadai</i>. For four months, my breakfast was
            <i>rende</i> (two)
            <i>Madala Vadai</i>
            and <i>onru</i> (one) tea. Food kept me going for a while, but I was lonely here.
            <br><br>
            Finally, The Good. One time I went to a famous and busy eatery and sat at a preoccupied table. I was trying
            to order
            Kalan (a mushroom dish), and I filtered coffee with all the pointing and mispronunciation possible. The
            Other person at
            the table recognised I wasn’t a native. He helped me order it and we started talking. He turned out to be
            another North
            Indian in the same incubator where my company was. He befriended me. Like this, I met many lovely people and
            made
            connections I will cherish. At one point, I had more people to talk to in Coimbatore than anywhere else. I
            had friends
            everywhere; at PG, work, and the places in between.
            <br>
            Yuval NoahHarari in Sapiens says humans have evolved slower cognitively than the other species. We still
            have the
            hunter-gathers mindset, and living in one place is a recent phenomenon. I experienced it this year when I
            truly started
            travelling. I covered all from the mountains of the Ooty to the beaches of Kochi and Kanyakumari. This year,
            I also did
            the most adventurous things, like going on a solo trip and driving a two-wheeler on hairpin bends; I learned
            nothing
            from January (＾_＾). I was happiest while I was on a trip.
            <br>
            Then came the time to say goodbye to Coimbatore and go to Bangalore, one of my hardest decisions. The love,
            encouragement and acceptance that I got from here are unmatched. This city is a character in itself. It has
            given me
            enough trouble but compensated me with friends and memories. My heart still aches a little when I talk about
            Coimbatore.
            But I am glad it happened.
